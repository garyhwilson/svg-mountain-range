# svg-mountain-range
The SVGMountainRange library comes from an effort to produce highly configurable, but procedurally generated SVG mountain ranges. It's original intent was for an old-fashioned pot-shot canon game where players take turns plotting angles and power in an attempt to shoot and destroy their opponent by lobbing rounds over mountain tops.
